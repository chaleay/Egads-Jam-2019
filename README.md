# Egads-Jam-2019

Dante Cash, Clayton Stamper, and Elijah Gaytan's project for the 2019 EGADS game jam at UT. 

# Re: Buried

For this game jam project, we experimented with several concepts there were entirely alien to us. First, we developed for the Magic Leap 
mixed reality headset, and second, we experimented with Boids. 

# What's it about?
You play as a Ghost Hunter. Evil ghosts are seeking asylum away from purgatory and have invaded the land of the living. It's your job to
stop them by shooting the crap out of them. 

Your job is to kill all of the ghosts before 10 of them escape back into their graves and haunt this world forever. 

# Play it!
Our final project is posted here and can be successfully built to any Magic Leap device using Unity 2019.2.2f or higher.
